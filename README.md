# Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Analysis

## Project Overview

Unlock the secrets of Cyclistic bike ridership with a data-driven analysis meticulously crafted by me. Leveraging Excel, R programming, and Tableau, I dissected Cyclistic's rider data to reveal the nuances between casual riders and annual members. The insights are more than just numbers; they're the roadmap to membership success. With compelling visualizations and data-backed recommendations, I stand ready to guide Cyclistic executives towards a strategic marketing plan aimed at converting casual riders into loyal annual members. Join the journey as we redefine the future of bike-sharing, one insightful analysis at a time.
